# AI4D Malawi News Classification Challenge
## Classifying news articles in Chichewa

This project is a response to Zindi's AI4D Malawi News Classification Challenge. More information about this challenge can be found [here](https://zindi.africa/competitions/ai4d-malawi-news-classification-challenge).
## Data source

The data used in this project is from the Zindi [AI4D Malawi News Classification Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/ai4d-malawi-news-classification-challenge/data).

## Requirements

1. Pandas - `pip install pandas`
2. Numpy - `pip install numpy`
3. Scikit-learn - `pip install scikit-learn`
4. Torch - `pip install torch`
5. Transformers - `pip install transformers`
6. Sentencepiece - `pip install sentencepiece`
7. nltk - `pip install nltk`

## Approach

I used a pretrained xlnet-base-cased model train a classification algorithm.
## Execution

Run `train_logistic_reg.py` in the `src` directory.
